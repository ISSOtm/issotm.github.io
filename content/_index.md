Hi!
[I'm Eldred](@/about.md).
I love programming, infosec, old game consoles, and researching them!

I spend a lot of my free time programming, so [I have written a nice amount of free software](//github.com/ISSOtm).

I've been tinkering with the old Game Boy for about 7 years now, so I have become a fairly active member of [GBDev](//gbdev.io).
Which, speaking of, I am also making [a tutorial for programming your own Game Boy games](//gbdev.io/gb-asm-tutorial) (with [some help](//github.com/gbdev/gb-asm-tutorial/contributors)) that is getting some praise as of late.
