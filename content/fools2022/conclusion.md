*Maybe the real enjoyment was the friends we made along the way.*

This year was different from other ones.

The event being all-online again was refreshing—certainly a bit more finicky, what with all the client and mGBA sometimes deciding to pout at each other until a restart (...okay?).

The biggest difference for me this year was the way I dealt with the Cracker's Cavern Reborn challenges: thanks to the April Fools on [pret](https://github.com/pret), I ended up on a voice chat with [pfero](https://github.com/mid-kid), and we ended up doing the third and fourth floors together.

A couple of other people popped in and out of the voice chat, and their input was sometimes helpful, but always appreciated! ^^
In the end, it might not have been in person, but it was really nice to be able to brainstorm ideas in realtime, discuss possible plans, and also just generally chat.

I think I'm starting to understand why some people participate in CTF teams.

Anyway, here is a list of people I want to thank:

- **pfero**: <q>It goes without saying, but it's better said out loud</q>—yeah, I've mentioned your name a dozen times or so already, but really, thanks, man.
  Thank you for being a cool guy, for sticking with me until the end, and for the back-and-forth (tools and ideas—you know what I mean).
  This wouldn't have been as much fun without you.
- **Darkshadows**, **Kirby703**, and everyone else on *TAF2S*: It's always nice to meet you all at this time of the year, and exchange tips! ;)
- Last but not least, **TheZZAZZGlitch**.
  Thanks for pouring the effort that you do into all of these events.
  It can't be easy coming up with all the ideas and designing then implementing everything, plus there's what you mentioned in `wholesome-reward.txt`, so... yeah.
  Thanks again, dude.

Thank you to you, too, for taking the time to read what I wrote!

Also, hi mom!
