## State of the game

The game is very much unfinished and has plenty of bugs. We know that, it's simply not finished yet.

However, the game is not being developed anymore. The current code base is a buggy and unworkable mess, so I have begun rewriting the entire game with a very ambitious goal in mind.

But, life and other projects/tasks have gotten in the way, and the rewrite's scope is huge, so not much progress can be shown (there's a lot that has been made under the hood, but it's impossible to notice it for now.) For now, Aevilia is shelved, but will hopefully resurface some day.
