## Contact

You may e-mail me at <code>me@&lt;firstName&gt;.fr</code>, replacing <code>&lt;firstName&gt;</code> with my first name... which is also this website's domain name.
(Simple anti-spam measure, I hope you understand.)

[I also toot](//social.treehouse.systems/@issotm) from time to time.
If you like programmer humor and Game Boy-related tweets, you should find yourself at home :)

## Stuff I do

I am very much into programming, spending a lot of time developing all sorts of tools.
My favourite programming languages are C, C++, and Rust—so, mostly systems programming, though as you are seeing, I dabble into other domains, such as the Web.

You can find my résumé in English [here 🇬🇧](/cv/en) ([PDF](/cv/en.pdf)), and *en français* [ici 🇫🇷](/cv/fr) ([PDF](/cv/fr.pdf)).

If you're curious about some of the work I've made, the effort I am currently spending the most time into is [RGBDS](//rgbds.gbdev.io) (I also made that website!).
You can also check out my [Codeberg profile](//codeberg.org/ISSOtm) for more of my work!

My mother tongue may be French, but I practice English on a daily basis, chatting with active English-speaking communities (mainly [GBDev](//gbdev.io)).
The quality of the English in this web site should be representative of my written and oral skills.
I have also studied German until high school, but haven't had a chance to practice it since then.
Finally, I am currently learning the basics of Japanese.
