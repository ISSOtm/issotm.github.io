## Technical explanation

### "SRAM hack"

You are probably familiar with the concept of a "ROM hack": a modification of a game that offers different content, bug fixes, or an entirely new game; in short, a different game with a similar base engine and maybe assets.

A SRAM hack provides a similar experience, but with a major difference: instead of being a modification of the game's ROM (code and/or data), the game is the save file. The save file is crafted in a way that the game loads data from the save file, and sometimes it's tricked into executing code stored in the save file.

### The start menu

The most notable "feature" of this hack is the player's inability to open the START menu. It's done using [OAM DMA hijacking](pokexploits/cartswap#oam-dma-hijacking). The hook function checks the video RAM for the top-left corner of the START menu. The function that opens the menu consistently waits for a few frames, so the state of the stack at this point is known, and some return addresses are repointed to the function that closes the START menu.
