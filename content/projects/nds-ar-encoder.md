[This online tool](/nds-ar-encoder) allows converting Nintendo DS Action Replay cheat codes as you find them on the Web, to and from a pseudo-code format!
This should help you understand how a given code works, and perhaps tweak it yourself?

The code was written using a code creation user manual found on Datel's website, though I have since then lost this document.

This is written entirely in vanilla JS, and although the parser is a little strict, it's quite usable.
