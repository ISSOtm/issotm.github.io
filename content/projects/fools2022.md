The yearly event returns, this time with a vengeance.
A remake of the 2018 edition, fully online again, and it's Generation III this time?
Buckle up, baby!

<!-- more -->

This year takes us back to the map of the 2018 event with the same premise (all maps downloaded from the internet)... but this time, with less glitchy blocks everywhere, oh and also we're on the GBA now.

[The event itself](https://zzazzdzz.github.io/fools2022) was a blast, with a bunch of secrets and objectives all over the place.
But, that's all the *normal* stuff.
Just north-east of the Eastern Camp, stands the Cracker Cavern, which is where people hungry for technical challenges (*<small>*timidly raises hand*</small>*) go to get their fix.

This year, I managed to complete all of them, placing me in 4th position overall! 🥳
As is tradition (...ignoring the 2021 edition for personal reasons), I wrote up on how I went about these challenges.

These are not intended for a particularly technical public, and are intended as much as walkthroughs for those who couldn't complete some of the challenges (don't be hard on yourself—they weren't easy!), as introductions to people curious as to how you'd even *begin* to approach these.
We all gotta start somewhere, yeah?

And reading others' writeups is how I got started myself! ;)
So without further ado, I present to you:
